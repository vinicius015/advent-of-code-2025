# Advent of Code 2025 — Ruby Solutions

This repository contains my Advent of Code 2025 solutions implemented in Ruby.

## Overview

- Language: Ruby
- Goal: Solve each Advent of Code puzzle for 2025 and keep solutions small, readable, and reusable.
- Layout: one folder per day under `challenges/` with the solver and the puzzle input.

This README documents how the repository is organized, how to run a day's solution, and conventions I follow so the project stays consistent.

## Repository structure

- `challenges/` — all day folders (e.g. `day-01/`, `day-02/`)
	- `day-XX.rb` — the Ruby script that implements the day's solutions
	- `input.txt` — the puzzle input for that day
- `utils/` — helper utilities used across solutions (e.g. `utils.rb`)
